# Claude Code Guidelines

## Database Safety

- **Never delete any data from the database unless explicitly asked**
- Even when explicitly asked to delete data, always ask for confirmation before executing the deletion
- Prefer soft deletes (marking records as inactive/deleted) over hard deletes when possible
